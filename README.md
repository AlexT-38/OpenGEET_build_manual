# OpenGEET_build_manual

### About OpenGEET

OpenGEET is an open source implementation of Paul Pantone's GEET fuel preprocessor and emmisions reduction system. The goal of this project is to create a set *detailed and explicit* instructions for manufacture, installation and operation of the GEET system, for the purpose of reproducibility and independent validation.

### Project structure and format

The project will consist of:

* This repository
    * Drawings and STEP models of all custom mechanical parts
    * Fusion360 cad files - pending review of licences and personal data in exported files
    * Manufacturing and assembly notes
    * Run in and operation instructions
    * Schematics and PCB art for all custom electronics
* Firmware repository
    * Firmware for all microcontrollers used in the above
    * Programs and scripts for processing collected data
    * Firmware manuals

# OpenGEET Build Manual
This repository contains all published drawings, CAD models and documentation for the OpenGEET project.

OpenGEET is an open source emmisions reduction system for small engines, based on the GEET system developed in the 1970's by Paul Pantone.
The intention is to make it easy to replicate the system and operate it correctly, so that the working principle can be investigated thoroughly and consistently reproduced.

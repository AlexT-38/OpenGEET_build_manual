# Inlet Restrictors

Used to restrict airflow into the system and provide the correct operating vacuum in the reactor over a wide range of flowrates. A system for a single cylinder engine requires optimal geometry to maintain the required vacuum over the length of the intake stroke. A three or more cylinder engine can make do with flat restrictors, since airflow is mostly constant.

Optimal geometry has an elliptical inlet profile and a 60° conic outlet profile.

#### Profiles

* A - inlet profile ellipse has dimensions 2.0x1.2mm, outlet is a 118° cone
* A0 - inlet profile ellipse has dimension 2.0x1.2mm, outlet is a 60° cone
